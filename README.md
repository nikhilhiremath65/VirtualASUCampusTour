### Steps to run our deliverable:

- Clone the master branch and open in unity

- Open Login Scene and run the scene.

### We have 3 user-role mappings to login:

#### Role: Student

For some mobile versions, Camera does not get detected for the first time,when we open QR the code scanner. The solution is to just close the app and start it again. It happens only once in the lifetime of the application.
